# Machine_Learning_Python
Applied Machine learning with python libraries.
Trained model by splitting dataset in to train and test sets(80-20).
**Supervised machine learning** is used to solve both classification and regression problems.

## Linear Regression
- A Linear Model that Predicts Salary Based on Years of experience.
- The model can be visualized from output.png file.
- Libraries used : Pandas | Matplotlib | Sklearn

## Multiple Linear Regression
- A Linear Model that Predicts profit Based on various expenditures done by company.
- The Difference of acutal and predicted values can be visualized from output.png file.
- Libraries used : Pandas | Matplotlib | Sklearn

## Polynomial Regression
- A Linear Model that Predicts Salary Based on your level post at company.
- Used Feature Scaling.
- The Difference of Linear and Polynomial model can be visualized from output.png file.
- Libraries used : Pandas | Matplotlib | Sklearn

## Logistic Regression
- A Model that Predicts whether the product will get purchased or not based on age and salary of person.
- The model can be visualized from output.png file.
- Comparing result through Confusion Matrix.
- Libraries used : Pandas | Matplotlib | Sklearn | Numpy

## k-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) Classifier
- A Model that Predicts whether the product will get purchased or not based on age and salary of person.
- The model can be visualized from output.png file.
- Used Feature Scaling.
- Comparing result through Confusion Matrix.
- Libraries used : Pandas | Matplotlib | Sklearn | Numpy

## Random Forest
- A classification algorithm consisting of many decisions trees that predicts type of flower.
- This model gives highest accuracy than others.
- Libraries used : Pandas | Matplotlib | Sklearn

## Natural Language Processing(NLP)
- A Model that Predictes whether reviews are good or bad.
- Algorithmn used to train model - GaussianNB
- Libraries used : Pandas | Matplotlib | Sklearn | re | nltk

## Sentiment Analysis
- It analyse the statement based on ratio of postive, negative and neutrality.
- Libraries used : vaderSentiment
