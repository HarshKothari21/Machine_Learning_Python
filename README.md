# Machine_Learning_Python
Applied Machine learning with the help of python libraries.Trained model by splitting dataset in to train and test sets(80-20).

## Linear Regression
- A Linear Model that Predictes Salary Based on Years of experience.
- The model can be visualized from output.png file.
- Libraries used : Pandas | Matplotlib | Sklearn

## Multiple Linear Regression
- A Linear Model that Predictes profit Based on various expenditures done by company.
- The Difference of acutal and predicted values can be visualized from output.png file.
- Libraries used : Pandas | Matplotlib | Sklearn

## Polynomial Regression
- A Linear Model that Predictes Salary Based on your level post at company.
- Used Feature Scaling.
- The Difference of Linear and Polynomial model can be visualized from output.png file.
- Libraries used : Pandas | Matplotlib | Sklearn

## Logistic Regression
- A Model that Predictes whether the product will get purchased or not based on age and salary of person.
- The model can be visualized from output.png file.
